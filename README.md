## General info
Machine Learning faculty project using heart.csv dataset to predict Heart Failure using ML algorithms and hyperparameter tunning.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Google Colaboratory

## Used Machine Learning Algorithms with and without hyperparameter tunning
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Decision Tree (DT)
* Random Forest (RF)
* K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
* GradientBoosting (GB)
* AdaBoosting (AB)
* XGBoosting (XGB)

## Creators
* Haxhi Celaj
* Visar Buza
	
## Setup

* Import 'Heart_Failure_Prediction.ipynb' file into collaboratory or add it from this repository.
* Upload the dataset 'heart.csv' which can be found inside this repo.
* Then, you need to Run All in collaboratory to run the nootebook.
